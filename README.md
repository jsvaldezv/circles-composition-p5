This project is a collection of generative visuals developed with p5.js, designed to run directly in the browser. Each sketch explores form, motion, and interaction through codeâ€”ranging from organic simulations to abstract compositions.

ðŸŽ¨ Visuals Included:

- Spore-inspired particle systems
- Geometric compositions with circles
- Bouncing balls with physics-like behavior
- "Sound worms" reacting to audio input or motion
- Experimental sketches combining motion, color, and repetition

All visuals are created using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, and are meant to be lightweight, interactive, and visually engaging.
